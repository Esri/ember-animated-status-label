The ember-animated-status-label addon provides a component that will show different labels that correspond to the pending, recently-settled, and settled promise states. This component also provides a subtle animated transition between each state.

The component transitions between three states to reflect the state of the promise: `Pending`, `Confirming`, and `Settled`.  When provided with a new promise, the component will transition to the `Pending` state.  If the promise resolves, it will transition to the `Confirming` state for a short time to show some confirmation content.  After showing the confirmation, or if the original promise rejects, the component will transition to the `Settled` state.

The component yields a hash that indicates the current state, through `isPending`, `isConfirming`, and `isSettled` properties.  The host app must supply the content that will be shown in each of those states.

## Including in an application

Here is the simplest way to get started with ember-animated-status-label:

```

**application.hbs**
```htmlbars
{{#animated-status-label promise=promise as |label|}}
  {{#if label.isPending}}
    <span>This text displays before the promise has resolved.</span>
  {{else if label.isConfirming}}
    <span>This text displays for a short time after the promise has resolved.</span>
  {{else if label.isSettled}}
    <span>This text displays when the promise has settled.</span>
  {{/if}}
{{/animated-status-label}}
```
